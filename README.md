vboxapi-py3
===========

Updates to Oracle's VirtualBox Python SDK for Python 3.  The files here are
normally found in VirtualBox/sdk/install/vboxapi.  I've used them successfully
in another project to start/stop instances, send keystrokes and take screen
shots.  Perhaps this will be useful for somebody else.
